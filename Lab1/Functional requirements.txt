Functional requirements

The program must be able to draw 3 types of figures: circle, rectangle, triangle; erase, move them, and save/load the canvas.

Warning: all numeric input values must be integers. If something goes wrong, an error will be shown on the screen.

Objects may be displayed with altered proportions due to the peculiarities of console output.

Menu
0 - exit (without saving)
1 - draw shape
    1 - circle
    2 - rectangle
    3 - triangle
2 - move object
3 - erase object
4 - undo last action
5 - redo last undone action
6 - save canvas to file
7 - load canvas from file

Drawing
The coordinate system for figures starts from the upper-left corner, extending right and downward. Figures must be drawn within the canvas boundaries.

To draw, choose a type (1, 2, 3) and then enter:

- For a circle: x, y, radius. (x, y) - coordinates of the top-left corner of the bounding box.
- For a rectangle: x, y, width, height. (x, y) - coordinates of the top-left corner.
- For a triangle: x, y, height. (x, y) - coordinates of the top-left corner.

Selecting and moving objects
To move an object, select it from the list and enter new coordinates:

- For a circle: x, y - new coordinates of the top-left corner of the bounding box.
- For a rectangle: x, y - new coordinates of the top-left corner.
- For a triangle: x, y - new coordinates of the top-left corner.

Erasing objects
Select an object from the list to erase it.

Saving the canvas
Enter the filename to save the current canvas state. The file will be stored in JSON format.

Loading the canvas
Enter the filename to load a previously saved canvas. This will replace the current canvas.

Undo/Redo actions
Undoing an action reverts the last modification (adding, moving, or erasing a shape). Redoing restores the most recently undone action. If a new action is performed after undoing, redo history is lost.
